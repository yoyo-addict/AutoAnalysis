The goal of this project is for Zach to demonstrate familiarity and skill with handling data from a multitude of aspects, from raw, uncleaned data, to polished data, to insights, predictive models, and more, demonstrating data engineering abilities with Docker and database design along the way.

NOTE FOR NOVEMBER 1: This scraper no longer seems to run, since the website it scrapes seems to have changed in design. However, I still consider the dataset I have amassed respectable in size.

WHAT IS SCRAPED?
- All cars listed within a 100-mile radius of each city in the filters-json file is scraped.
- Each record from each car contains the following data points:
  - Make/Year
  - Model, often with trim details
  - Listed price
  - Rated assessment of the price (e.g. good deal/bad deal, scraped directly from the website)
  - Mileage
 
Have fun scraping!
